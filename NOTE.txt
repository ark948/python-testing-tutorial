unittest is python builtin.
unittest ensures small pieces of program (called units) work correctly. 

the unittest provides xUnit terminology

using assertions, we will test for expected outcomes, such as values and exceptions that must be raised

test fixtures (such as setUp and tearDown)
By definition, a test fixture is a function or method that runs before and after a block of test code executes. In other words, it is a step carried out before or after a test.

test fixtures can be module level, class level, or method level

if there are many test modules in tests folder, using unittest.main() may not be efficient.
in such case, using unittest commands is better:

1. run all tests (in the directory with tests folder):
cmd> python -m unittest discover -v

2. run a single test module: (DO NOT INCLUDE 'py')
cmd> python -m unittest test_package.test_module -v

3. run a single test class:
cmd> python -m unittest test_package.test_module.TestClass -v

4. run a signle test method:
cmd> python -m unittest test_package.test_module.TestClass.test_method -v
