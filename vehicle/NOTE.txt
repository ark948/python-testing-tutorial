the alert function takes the speed of the vehicle from the speed function.
speed returns a random number between 40 and 120.

if speed is too slow (below 60) or too fast (above 100), an alert is made (returns true).

the return value of the speed() is varied. therefore the result is unpredictable, and cannot be easily tested.
