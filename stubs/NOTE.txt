Because the temperature() method of the Sensor returns a random temperature, itâ€™ll be difficult to test various scenarios to ensure the Alarm class works properly.

To resolve it, you can define a stub for the Sensor class called TestSensor. The TestSensor has the temperature property that returns a value provided when its object is initialized.

(Folder structure in this part is a mess.)

I will put everything in one place.

to create stubs more easily, we can use the MockMagic object
